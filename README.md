To run the program, type the following command:
	./naiveBayesClassifier.R spamLabelled.dat spamUnlabelled.dat

Note: I have made the script executable, therefore the command above should
work. However just in case something went astray (the script become
unexecutable), please use the following command to make the script executable
first:
	chmod +x naiveBayesClassifier.R
And then run the program using the first command.
